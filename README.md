# Don-t-Let-the-Bark-Beetle-Bite-You #

The supporting material for the dissertation includes the _code_ (1), _majority of the data used_ (2), _newly developed data-sets_, and _results_ of the project. All of these are accessed through their own folders.

## 

Here is the list of all the folders and what they contain: 

## Code ## 
There are five .ipynb folders avaialble in this folder.

* **model.ipynb** : contains the whole model
* **milanov_vrh_test.ipynb** : tests conducted on the region of Milanov Vrh
* **parameter_tunning.ipynb** : operations for the search of best parameter combination for cloud-masking component
* **infected_regions_test.ipynb** : tests conducted on the regions that had been attacked by the bark beetle
* **cloud_masking_evaluation.ipynb** : tests on the performance of the cloud masking algorithm

## Data ## 
Contains a set of data for regions in Slovenia and the ones in Croatia. These can be accessed           through their respective folders.

- Slovenia : Contains a document where all the regions are stated in coordinates - the reports have been preprocessed and the coordinates have been taken out. As the reports were in Slovenian language they were not submitted here.
- Cabar : Contains two files, one with the coordinates for the two damaged forest areas in the Cabar region in Croatia, and the second one with the raw data for the Milanov Vrh area (this one is in Croatian!)

## New Data Sets ##
Contains three files: 
- _Locations of Regions_ contains only the coordinate locations of the regions that had been used in this study - the ones that have been attacked. 
- _Locations of Regions and Years_ contains the same information as the previous file however it also provides the year prior and the year of the attack so that the images can be accessed more easily. 
- _Milanov Vrh_ contains raw data for the region of Milanov Vrh.

## Results ## 
This folder contains only the test results for the regional tests - if the model can recognise the bark beetle attack - and the results of different combinations of parameters for the cloud-masking algorithm. 
  
## Notes ##
Please note that the images used have not been put as part of the supporting material as this required much more organisation. If you do want to run particular tests, please contact me on marko.mekjavic@gmail.com and I will send you the necessary instructions and missing materials.
