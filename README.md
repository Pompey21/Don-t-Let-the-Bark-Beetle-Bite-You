# Don-t-Let-the-Bark-Beetle-Bite-You

The supporting material for the dissertation includes the code (1), majority of the data used (2), newly developed data-sets (3), and the results (4) of the project. All of these are accessed through their own folders.

## break

Here is the list of all the folders and what they contain: 

## Code
There are five .ipynb folders avaialble in this folder.

          * Bullet list
              * Nested bullet
                  * Sub-nested bullet etc
          * Bullet list item 2
          
  Markup : - Bullet list
              - Nested bullet
                  - Sub-nested bullet etc
          - Bullet list item 2 

Markup : * model.ipynb : contains the whole model
         * milanov_vrh_test.ipynb : tests conducted on the region of Milanov Vrh
         * parameter_tunning.ipynb : operations for the search of best parameter combination for cloud-masking component
         * infected_regions_test.ipynb : tests conducted on the regions that had been attacked by the bark beetle
         * cloud_masking_evaluation.ipynb : tests on the performance of the cloud masking algorithm

## Data
  (2) Data : Contains a set of data for regions in Slovenia and the ones in Croatia. These can be accessed           through their respective folders.
        - Slovenia : Contains a document where all the regions are stated in coordinates - the reports have been preprocessed and the coordinates have been taken out. As the reports were in Slovenian language they were not submitted here.
        - Cabar : Contains two files, one with the coordinates for the two damaged forest areas in the Cabar region in Croatia, and the second one with the raw data for the Milanov Vrh area (this one is in Croatian!)

## New Data Sets
  (3) New Data Sets : Contains three files: 'Locations of Regions' contains only the coordinate locations of the regions that had been used in this study - the ones that have been attacked, 'Locations of Regions and Years' contains the same information as the previous file however it also provides the year prior and the year of the attack so that the images can be accessed more easily, 'Milanov Vrh' contains raw data for the region of Milanov Vrh.

## Results
  (4) Results : this file contains only the test results for the regional tests - if the model can recognise the bark beetle attack - and the results of different combinations of parameters for the cloud-masking algorithm. 
  
## Notes
Please note that the images used have not been put as part of the supporting material as this required much more organisation. If you do want to run particular tests, please contact me on marko.mekjavic@gmail.com and I will send you the necessary instructions and missing materials.
